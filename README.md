# Abiathar Support
This repository houses the bug database for [Abiathar](http://www.pckf.com/viewtopic.php?t=3023). To report a problem, request a feature, or ask a question, open the **Issues** tab on the right and provide a detailed description. (Issue filing requires a GitHub account.) If you do not check GitHub frequently, please provide a means of contacting you for further information. (A PCKF username is fine.)

This repository contains no code. Please do not submit pull requests, as they will be denied.

## Issue labels
If reporting a bug, use the "bug" label and the "bug-*" label that best categorizes the problem. For example, if you've found a bug that results in the corruption of levels, file the issue under "bug" and "bug-corrupts-res". Do not use the green/resolved bug labels, such as "bug-fixed". These will be affixed after the bug is investigated and resolved.

If asking a question, use the "kb-question" label only. The "kb-answered" label will be affixed after the question is thoroughly addressed.

If requesting a feature, use the "request" label only. The appropriate "request-*" label will be affixed after the request has been considered and, in the case of "request-done", implemented.
